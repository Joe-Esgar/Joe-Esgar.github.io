                This site uses some great new tech as well as some more
                traditional ones. My team and I used hooks, React.js, CSS3,
                SCSS, HTML5, Javascript, express, bcrypt, react-toastify,
                formik, postgresql, ect. to create a useful app. It was a great
                teambuilding experience. My main area of contribution in this
                app was in planning, server and database functionality, restful
                endpoints. My greatest personal challenge was in creating our
                private chat feature that utilizes sockets and dynamically
                generated room names to allow users to communicate.

            I have been engaged in web development since Jan, 2019. I am proud
            to have started on my own using sites like The Odin Project, among
            others. I completed some of the lessons and mini-projects there and
            had alot of fun learning from that community. I pursued my passion
            at DevMountain and grew alot with my classmates as we worked
            together, 40 hours a week and many hours outside of class. I am
            always working and growing on my own, learning new tech and looking
            for fun new teams to join.

          After attending Kirkwood Community College in Iowa City, Iowa, I
          decided to pursue a career in web development. I attended
          <a href="https://devmountain.com/">DevMountain</a> in Phoenix,
          Arizona. DevMountain is a 13-week Web Development Bootcamp that
          teaches HTML, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Git, Github, NodeJS, ReactJS,
          and Redux. Studying and working with my team in a tech environment was
          a personal renaissance. I also learned many new technologies on my
          own, in the completion of my projects there.
